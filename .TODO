- [x] A CLI Tool called "seri" which when run does the following
  - [x] Takes a JS file, parses it and constructs an execution.json file
  - [x] Takes the execution.json file and converts to alloy predicate & function calls

- [x] Work on v1 of the structure of the execution.json

- [x] Work on v1 of the "PREDEFINED" in alloy

- [x] Work on v1 of the "COMPILED" in alloy

- [x] Wire "seri" to read the output of alloy and check if any counterexamples show up

### NEXT TODO

- [x] Switch over to TypeScript

- [ ] Modularize our code

- [ ] Find an ast generator and start using it to create a stripped down JSON of the generated AST

- [ ] Create a tool which takes the JSON and create an Alloy representation of the JSON

- [ ] Write some assertions that would directly check properties on the compiled alloy code
